# Requirements Document

## Introduction

An interactive educational game designed to teach high school students fundamental concepts of electrical circuits through hands-on simulation and gamified learning experiences. The game will provide a visual, engaging platform where students can build, test, and experiment with various electrical components and circuit configurations while receiving immediate feedback and guidance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a high school student, I want to build electrical circuits by dragging and dropping components, so that I can learn circuit construction in an intuitive visual way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses the circuit builder THEN the system SHALL display a workspace with available electrical components (resistors, capacitors, batteries, switches, LEDs, wires)
2. WHEN a student drags a component from the component palette THEN the system SHALL allow placement of the component on the circuit board
3. WHEN a student connects two components with a wire THEN the system SHALL create a visual connection and establish electrical continuity
4. WHEN a student attempts an invalid connection THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating why the connection is not allowed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a high school student, I want to see real-time simulation of my circuits, so that I can understand how electricity flows and components behave.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes a circuit THEN the system SHALL simulate electrical flow and display current, voltage, and resistance values
2. WHEN current flows through a component THEN the system SHALL animate the current flow with visual indicators
3. WHEN a component receives power THEN the system SHALL show appropriate visual feedback (LED lighting up, motor spinning)
4. WHEN a circuit has issues (short circuit, open circuit) THEN the system SHALL highlight the problem area and explain the issue

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a high school student, I want to progress through structured lessons and challenges, so that I can learn circuit concepts systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student starts the game THEN the system SHALL present a series of progressive lessons starting with basic concepts
2. WHEN a student completes a lesson THEN the system SHALL unlock the next lesson and award progress points
3. WHEN a student encounters a new concept THEN the system SHALL provide interactive tutorials and explanations
4. WHEN a student struggles with a concept THEN the system SHALL offer hints and alternative explanations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a high school student, I want to receive immediate feedback on my circuit designs, so that I can learn from mistakes and understand correct principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student builds an incorrect circuit THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback about what went wrong
2. WHEN a student makes a correct connection THEN the system SHALL provide positive reinforcement
3. WHEN a student completes a challenge successfully THEN the system SHALL explain why the solution works
4. WHEN a student requests help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual hints without giving away the complete solution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a high school student, I want to track my learning progress and achievements, so that I can see my improvement and stay motivated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes activities THEN the system SHALL track and display their progress through the curriculum
2. WHEN a student demonstrates mastery of concepts THEN the system SHALL award badges and achievements
3. WHEN a student logs in THEN the system SHALL show their current progress and suggest next activities
4. WHEN a student completes all lessons in a topic THEN the system SHALL unlock advanced challenges and free-play mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to monitor student progress and identify learning gaps, so that I can provide targeted support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display student progress across all topics
2. WHEN a student struggles with specific concepts THEN the system SHALL flag these areas for teacher attention
3. WHEN a teacher reviews student work THEN the system SHALL show detailed analytics of student interactions and common mistakes
4. WHEN a teacher wants to assign specific activities THEN the system SHALL allow creation of custom assignments and challenges
